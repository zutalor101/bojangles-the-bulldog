## Brief Description

Participants will learn how to write some basic programs using the Python programming language, and explore key transferable programming concepts.

## Structure

This module comprises 11 sessions which, after the first two, each focus upon an different area of functionality, escalating in complexity. This module is typically taught over the course of a week. Once each lesson is taught, the module ends with an application project and presentation which takes at least 2 days to complete.
