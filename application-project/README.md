## Application Project Overview
---

The final application project challenges learners to plan and create their own CLI based application. The learners will be given a prompt from a book cafe, who is looking to create a menu system to keep track of their orders and customers. The learners will need to  use their knowledge from the course to build this application from conception to reality. 

There are two versions of this project, the best route should be chosen by the instructor based off what they think the class will feel most confident in doing.  Both versions will lead to the same outcome, except version 1 is reccomended for intermediate-advanced students and version 2 is reccomended for beginners. To see more about version 1 of the project, please start with the 'application-project-v1' folder. To se emore about version 2 of the project, please start with the 'application-project-v2' folder. Take a look at the README files for both to see more details on how to approach the project and what materials need to be used.
