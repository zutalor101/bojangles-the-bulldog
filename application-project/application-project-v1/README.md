This folder provides all materials (or links to materials) needed to conduct the final application project for the Generation Python course. Here is a breakdown of what is in each folder: 

- materials - in this folder is everything needed to conduct the aplication project. The application-project.md file should be distributed to each learner. It contains the prompt for what the project/client is looking for and what information to include in their presentations. There is also a pseudo-code available to distribute. The pseudo-code will act as a skeleton code to help get learners started. 
- solutions - In this folder is some example code to show what the learners should produce by the end of this project. Also provided in this folder, is past learner code examples to show excellent pieces of code (that deserved high points). Take a look at these to get any idea of what the end goal of the application project is.
