Below is a skeleton code to help get started! The skeleton code will not run, you will need to figure out how to fix the syntax to make it work. However, it can give you an idea of how to get started.
Do not feel like you need to follow this exactly. If you find a way to improve the code or want to add anything, please feel free to do so! Good luck!
