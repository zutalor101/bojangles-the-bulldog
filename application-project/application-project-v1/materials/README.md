## Materials
---
This folder contains all materials needed to conduct the final application project for the Generation Python course. The application-project.md file should be distributed to each learner. It contains the main prompt for what the project/client is looking for and what information to include in their presentations. There is also a pseudo-code available to distribute. The pseudo-code will act as a skeleton code to help get learners started.

#### Quick-Start Overview of Application Project
---
This project is about a book cafe that serves drinks, a selection of foods, and a good selection of bestselling books. Learners will be working as a team with a group of fellow classmates to develop a CLI based application to meet to needs of a client (the instructor). The code should run fully within Visual Studio Code (VSC) with a back-up copy located within Github. Here is a bullet-point list of minimum expectations for the project:

1. The application should showcase a list of menu and book items. 
2. Customers should be able to choose their food and drinks items and/or books items and be able to view their orders. 
3. Staff should be able to update, add, and delete the menu/book items and view customer details for book delivery service. 

The aim of the project is for learners to showcase their knowledge of Python and develop their skills through practice. The project does have minimum expectations for functionality, however, it can be as basic or as advanced as the learner wants it to be. Take a look at the application-project.md file for the full requirements and rubric for the project. There is also a pseudo-code available that gives a skeleton structure to help get started. The pseudo-code will not run as it is, learners should correct the syntax in order to get it working. 

Once the code has been completed, teams of learners are expected to present their code to the class. The presentations should be no more than 10 minutes long, and each team member is expected to speak about their experience and part within the project. Here is a list of topics the learners should discuss in their presentations:

1. Walk everyone through your program. How does it work? Show examples of how it runs. Explain what you have used in your code! Be proud to show off your work!
2. What was your favorite part of the project?
3. Did you learn anything new while doing this project? If so, what was it?
4. What sort of challenges did you and your group encounter? How did you overcome these challenges?
5. If you had more time, what would you do to improve your code/build on it?

At the end of each presentation, all learners will provide feedback for each presenting team via the peer feedback form (located below) based on the rubric that is provided in the application-project.md file. Instructors will also provide feedback to each team regarding their technical, teamwork, and presentation skills. 

The biggest advice for the project, is to have fun with it! The project is meant to be a learning activity to help solidify knowledge learned within the course thus far and to give learners a unique opportunity to collaborate with their colleagues. Good luck!
