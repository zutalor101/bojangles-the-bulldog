# Exercise 7: User Input and While Loops

Please work through as many of the following exercises as you’re able to in the allotted time and upload the results of the last task you were able to complete.

### 1.
Write a program that asks the user what kind of rental car they would like. Print a message about that car, such as “Let me see if I can find you a Subaru.”

### 2.
Write a program that asks the user how many people are in their dinner group. If the answer is more than eight, print a message saying they’ll have to wait for a table. Otherwise, report that their table is ready.

### 3.
Ask the user for a number, and then report whether the number is a multiple of 10 or not.

### 4.
Write a loop that prompts the user to enter a series of pizza toppings until they enter a 'quit' value. As they enter each topping, print a message saying you’ll add that topping to their pizza.

### 5.
A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a person’s age. If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15. Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost of their movie ticket.

### 6.
Write a loop that never ends, and run it (if you dare!). (To end the loop, press ctrl-C or close the window displaying the output.)


## Stretch and Challenge
If you complete the previous steps within the allotted time please move on to the following.

### 7.
Make a list called sandwich_orders and fill it with the names of various sandwiches. Then make an empty list called finished_sandwiches. Loop through the list of sandwich orders and print a message for each order, such as I made your tuna sandwich. As each sandwich is made, move it to the list of finished sandwiches. After all the sandwiches have been made, print a message listing each sandwich that was made.

-	Using the list sandwich_orders from Exercise 7-8, make sure the sandwich 'pastrami' appears in the list at least three times. Add code near the beginning of your program to print a message saying the deli has run out of pastrami, and then use a while loop to remove all occurrences of 'pastrami' from sandwich_orders. Make sure no pastrami sandwiches end up in finished_sandwiches.

### 8.
Write a program that polls users about their dream vacation. Write a prompt similar to If you could visit one place in the world, where would you go? Include a block of code that prints the results of the poll.
